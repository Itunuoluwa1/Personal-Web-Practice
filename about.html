      <h2>Why die silently when you can always get consultations?</h2>
      <p>
        It has come to my awareness that people die due to inability to get
        consultations because of certain reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The nature of some people's job gives them little chance to attend to
          what really matters, <strong>their health</strong>. It's usually
          cumbersome for them to attend to work and still monitor their health.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some people are unable to get medical attention due to distance and
          the location that they might be.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also, some people are due to age. It's not easy for an aged person to
          be going to an hospital on regular basis whereas, they need medical
          attendance.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, some don't get medical attendance because of ignorance and
          even procrastination. This is the most unexplainable reason but still
          the commonest occurence.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Digital Diagnosis Site was oriented to create interactions between
        health practitioners and people in need of consultations. On DDS, you
        can easily get a doctor's appointment and meet with the doctor all
        online without batting an eyelid. One can as well get similar illness
        prescription for trivial matters. They'd be regular medical assistance
        for old people.
